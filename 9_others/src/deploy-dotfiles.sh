# THE single implementation, shared by every repo. cloud's richer
# 9_others/build.sh calls it as its `dotfiles` verb; repos without cloud's
# TypeScript engines ship a thin build.sh that calls exactly the same script.
# Duplicating this logic per repo is how the gitea mirror list drifted — one
# implementation, many callers.
#
# Plain POSIX sh + node (for JSON only). No repo-specific assumptions.
#
# node, not python3: node is already an unconditional dependency of every
# caller (the derive engines are TypeScript run through tsx), whereas python3
# is NOT installed in the cloud-builder image. gen-configs died here on
# 2026-08-10 with "python3: command not found" — and because the interpreter
# failure was swallowed by the `|| FATAL: invalid JSON` guard below, the error
# accused the data instead of naming the missing interpreter.
#
# Deploy is ADDITIVE PER FILE and never purges the target directory. Unlike
# 1_cicd/dist, the target dirs mix managed config with per-machine state:
#   .obsidian/workspace.json        pane ids + layout for ONE device
#   .claude/settings.local.json     documented place for local overrides
#   .claude/agents/                 may exist per-repo and is not ours
# A purge-then-copy would destroy all of that on every build. Files are copied
# individually so anything not named in src/ is left exactly as found.
